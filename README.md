<h1>Hi Baby!</h1>
<h2>Use link to go to the Gitter chat for this Repository. Just click join chat and when you get to it just make an account by linking your GitHub account. Of course we don't have to use Gitter. Like you said we can use Skype if you want which would be nice cause we can voice call. It's your call baby,I love you:heart:</h2>
